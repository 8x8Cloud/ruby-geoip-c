= What?
This is a library which provides a single function. The function takes as
input an IP address and it outputs a hash containing best-guess geographical
information (like city, country, latitude, and longitude).

Actually this is only a Ruby binding to a C library which provides this
function. Also, you must download a large binary database with all this
mapping information. It is kindly provided free of charge by MaxMind.com. 

= Usage
   require 'geoip_city'
   db = GeoIPCity::Database.new('/opt/GeoIP/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat')
   result = db.look_up('24.24.24.24')
   p result 
   # => {:city=>"Ithaca", 
   #     :latitude=>42.4277992248535, 
   #     :longitude=>-76.4981994628906, 
   #     :country_code3=>"USA", 
   #     :country_code=>"US",
   #     :country_name=>"United States", 
   #     :dma_code=>555,
   #     :area_code=>607, 
   #     :region=>"NY" }

= Install
Some variation of the following should work.

1. Install the GeoCity C library. You can get it from here  
   http://www.maxmind.com/app/c
   For example, I like to install mine in /opt/GeoIP
   so I do this:
     tar -zxvf GeoIP-1.4.3.tar.gz 
     cd GeoIP-1.4.3
     ./configure --prefix=/opt/GeoIP
     make && sudo make install

2. Now install the geoip_city gem 
     sudo gem install geoip_city -- --with-geoip-dir=/opt/GeoIP

3. Download the GeoLite City database file in binary format from:
   http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
   Maybe this direct link will work:
   http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
   I put this file in 
   /opt/GeoIP/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat


4. Use it!
